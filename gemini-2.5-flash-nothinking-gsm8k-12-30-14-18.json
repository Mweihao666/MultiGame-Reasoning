This means the *increase itself* is 150% of the original value.\n    *   Increase amount = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n    *   New Value (Selling Price) = Original Value + Increase Amount\n    *   Selling Price = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n    *Self-correction/Alternative interpretation check:* Sometimes \"increased to 150%\" is used, which would mean the new value is 1.5 times the old. But \"increased *by* 150%\" clearly means the *additional* amount is 150% of the original. The phrasing \"increased the value of the house by 150%\" means the *new value* is the original value plus 150% of the original value, which is 250% of the original value.\n    Let's re-read carefully: \"This increased the value of the house by 150%.\"\n    This means the *new value* is the *original value* + (150% of the original value).\n    Original value = $80,000.\n    Increase = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n    New value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.

This means the new value is the original value plus 150% of the original value.\n3.  **Calculate Profit:** New Value - Total Cost.\n\n*   Total Cost = $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000\n*   Increase in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n*   New Value (Selling Price) = Original value + Increase = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n*   Profit = Selling Price - Total Cost = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000\n</think>\n<answer>\nJosh's total cost for the house was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\n\nThe value of the house increased by 150% of its original purchase price:\nIncrease in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\nThe new value of the house is its original value plus the increase:\nNew Value = $80,000 + $120,000", "<think>\nThe user is asking to calculate the total meters James runs in a week.\nI need to break this down:\n1.

Convert total eggs to dozens.\n</think>\n<answer>\nClaire eats 3 eggs per day.\nIn one week, she eats 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs.\nIn 4 weeks, she eats 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.\nSince there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she will eat 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens of eggs.\n\nShe will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.\n</answer>", "<think>\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** Marissa wants her *average speed* for the *entire 12-mile trail* to be 4 miles per hour.\n\n2.  **Recall Average Speed Formula:** Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\n3.  **Identify Knowns for the *Entire Trip*:**\n    *   Total Distance = 12 miles\n    *   Desired Average Speed = 4 mph\n\n4.  **Calculate Desired Total Time:**\n    *   Using the formula: Total Time = Total Distance / Desired Average Speed\n    *   Total Time = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours\n\n5.  **Analyze Marissa's Progress So Far:**\n    *   **Segment 1:**\n        *   Distance = 4 miles\n        *   Time = 1 hour\n    *   **Segment 2:**\n        *   Distance = 2 miles\n        *   Time = 1 hour\n\n6.  **Calculate Distance Covered So Far:**\n    *   Distance Covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles\n\n7.  **Calculate Time Elapsed So Far:**\n    *   Time Elapsed = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours\n\n8.  **Calculate Remaining Distance:**\n    *   Remaining Distance = Total Distance - Distance Covered\n    *   Remaining Distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles\n\n9.  **Calculate Remaining Time:**\n    *   Remaining Time = Desired Total Time - Time Elapsed\n    *   Remaining Time = 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour\n\n10. **Calculate Required Speed for the Remaining Distance:**\n    *   Speed = Distance / Time\n    *   Speed for Remaining Distance = Remaining Distance / Remaining Time\n    *   Speed = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph\n\n11. **Final Check:**\n    *   Total Distance: 4 + 2 + 6 = 12 miles (Correct)\n    *   Total Time: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 hours (Correct)\n    *   Average Speed: 12 miles / 3 hours = 4 mph (Correct)\n</think>\n<answer>\nTo achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the 12-mile trail, Marissa needs to complete the entire trail in:\nTotal Time = Total Distance / Desired Average Speed = 12 miles / 4 mph = 3 hours.\n\nSo far, Marissa has walked:\nDistance covered = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles.\nTime elapsed = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours.\n\nThe remaining distance is:\nRemaining Distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.\n\nThe remaining time she has to complete the trail is:\nRemaining Time = 3 hours (total desired) - 2 hours (elapsed) = 1 hour.\n\nTo walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour, her speed must be:\nRequired Speed = Remaining Distance / Remaining Time = 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.\n</answer>"]
