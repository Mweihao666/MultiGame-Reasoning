Profit is calculated as (Selling Price - Total Cost).\n\n2.  **Identify Given Information:**\n    *   Initial purchase price: $80,000\n    *   Repair costs: $50,000\n    *   Value increase: 150% (This applies to the *initial* value, not the total cost).\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Cost:**\n    *   Total Cost = Purchase Price + Repair Costs\n    *   Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n4.  **Calculate the New Value (Selling Price):**\n    *   The house's value *increased by* 150% of its *original* value.\n    *   Increase amount = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n    *   New Value = Original Value + Increase Amount\n    *   New Value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\n    *Self-correction/Alternative interpretation check:* \"increased the value of the house by 150%\". This means the *new* value is the original value PLUS 150% *of* the original value. So, the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original value.\n    *   New Value = 250% of $80,000 = 2.50 * $80,000 = $200,000. This confirms the previous calculation.\n\n5.  **Calculate Profit:**\n    *   Profit = New Value (Selling Price) - Total Cost\n    *   Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation:** State the profit clearly.\n<think>\nHere's my thought process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Costs:** Josh's total investment is the purchase price plus repairs.\n    *   Purchase Price: $80,000\n    *   Repair Costs: $50,000\n    *   Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n2.  **Calculate the Increase in Value:** The value increased by 150% of the *original* purchase price.\n    *   Increase Amount = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n\n3.  **Calculate the New Value (Selling Price):** The new value is the original price plus the increase.\n    *   New Value = Original Price + Increase Amount\n    *   New Value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\n4.  **Calculate Profit:** Profit is the New Value minus the Total Cost.\n    *   Profit = New Value - Total Cost\n    *   Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000\n</think>\n<answer>\nJosh's total cost for the house was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\n\nThe value of the house increased by 150% of its original price:\n150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\nThe new value of the house is its original price plus the increase:\n$80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nHis profit is the new value minus his total cost:\n$200,000 -
