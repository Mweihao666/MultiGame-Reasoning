It also states that it takes half that much white fiber. I need to calculate the amount of white fiber and then add the blue and white fiber amounts to find the total.\n\n1. Blue fiber: 2 bolts\n2. White fiber: half of 2 bolts = 1 bolt\n3. Total fiber: Blue fiber + White fiber </think>\n<answer> A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt takes half that much white fiber, which is 1 bolt (2 / 2 = 1).\nIn total, it takes 2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts. </answer>", "<think>\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the *profit* Josh made. Profit is calculated as (Selling Price) - (Total Costs).\n\n2.  **Identify Costs:**\n    *   Initial purchase price: $80,000\n    *   Repair costs: $50,000\n    *   Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n3.  **Calculate Selling Price (Increased Value):**\n    *   The original value *before* repairs was the purchase price: $80,000.\n    *   The problem states the *value of the house* increased by 150%. This is a bit ambiguous. Does it mean 150% *of the original purchase price* or 150% *of the total investment*?\n    *   The most common interpretation in \"value increase\" problems after repairs is that the *final value* is based on the *original value* plus the increase. So, the value *after* repairs is 150% *more than* the original value.\n    *   Original value: $80,000\n    *   Increase amount: 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n    *   New Value (Selling Price) = Original Value + Increase Amount = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\n    *Self-correction/Alternative Interpretation Check:* What if it meant the *new value is 150% of the original value*? That would mean the new value is 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000. This seems less likely given \"increased by 150%\". \"Increased by X%\" usually means \"original + X% of original\".\n\n    *What if it meant the *total investment* increased by 150%?* Total investment = $130,000. Increase = 1.50 * $130,000 = $195,000. New value = $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000. This is also a possible interpretation, but \"increased the value of the house by 150%\" most naturally refers to the *original value* of the house as the base for the percentage increase, especially since the repairs *caused* the increase.\n\n    Let's stick with the most common interpretation: the original value ($80,000) increased by 150% of *itself*.\n\n    So, new value = $80,000 * (1 + 1.50) = $80,000 * 2.50 = $200,000. This confirms my previous calculation.\n\n4.  **Calculate Profit:**\n    *   Profit = Selling Price - Total Costs\n    *   Profit = $200,000 - $130,000\n    *   Profit = $70,000\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Costs: $80k + $50k = $130k\n    *   Original value: $80k\n    *   Increase: 150% of $80k = $120k\n    *   New value: $80k + $120k = $200k\n    *   Profit: $200k - $130k = $70k.\n    The numbers align.\n</think>\n<answer>\nJosh's total cost for the house is:\n$80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000\n\nThe value of the house increased by 150% of its original purchase price.\nIncrease in value = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n\nThe new value of the house (selling price) is:\n$80,000 (original value) + $120,000 (increase", "<think> The user is asking for the total meters James runs in a week.\nI need to calculate:\n1.
