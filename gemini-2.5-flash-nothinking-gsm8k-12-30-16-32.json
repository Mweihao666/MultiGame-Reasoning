["<think> The user is asking to calculate the daily earnings from selling duck eggs.\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with the total number of eggs laid per day.\n2. Subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast.\n3. Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins.\n4. The remaining eggs are sold.\n5. Multiply the number of sold eggs by the price per egg to find the daily earnings. </think>\n<answer> Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 for breakfast, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.\nShe bakes with 4, so 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.\nShe sells 9 eggs at $2 each.\n9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.\nJanet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. </answer>", "<think> The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. It also states that it takes half that much white fiber. I need to calculate the amount of white fiber and then add it to the amount of blue fiber to find the total.\n\n1.  **Blue fiber:** 2 bolts\n2.  **White fiber:** Half of the blue fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt\n3.  **Total fiber:** Blue fiber + White fiber </think>\n<answer>\nBlue fiber: 2 bolts\nWhite fiber: 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt\nTotal bolts: 2 + 1 = 3 bolts\n</answer>", "<think>\nHere's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for Josh's *profit*. Profit is calculated as (Selling Price) - (Total Costs).\n\n2.  **Identify Costs:**\n    *   Initial purchase price: $80,000\n    *   Repair costs: $50,000\n    *   Total Cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n3.  **Calculate the Increased Value (Selling Price):**\n    *   The problem states the value increased by 150%. This means the *new* value is the original value *plus* 150% of the original value.\n    *   Original value *before* repairs (and before the increase) is the purchase price: $80,000.\n    *   Increase amount = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n    *   New Value (Selling Price) = Original Value + Increase Amount = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n    *Self-correction/Alternative interpretation check:* Sometimes \"increased by X%\" can be interpreted as the *new value is X% of the old value*. However, \"increased *by* 150%\" almost universally means the *addition* is 150% of the original. If it meant the new value was 150% of the old, the new value would be $80,000 * 1.50 = $120,000. This would imply the repairs *decreased* the value relative to the cost, which isn't typically how these problems are phrased for a positive outcome. The phrasing \"increased *the value of the house by* 150%\" points to the *original value* as the base for the percentage increase.\n\n4.  **Calculate Profit:**\n    *   Profit = Selling Price - Total Costs\n    *   Profit = $200,000 - $130,000\n    *   Profit = $70,000\n\n5.  **Final Check:** Does the answer make sense?\n    *   Costs: $130,000\n    *   Selling Price: $200,000\n    *   Profit: $70,000. Yes, $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000. The numbers align.\n</think>\n<answer>\nFirst, calculate the total cost:\nTotal Cost = Purchase Price + Repair Costs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\nNext, calculate the increased value of the house. The value increased by 150% of the original purchase price:\nIncrease Amount = 150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\nNew Value (Selling Price) = Original Purchase Price + Increase Amount = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\nFinally, calculate the profit:\nProfit = Selling Price - Total Cost = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000\n</answer>", "<think> The user is asking for the total meters James runs in a week.\nI need to calculate:\n1.
