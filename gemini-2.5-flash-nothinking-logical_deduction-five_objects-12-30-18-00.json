    "<think> The user wants me to determine the order of the five books and then identify which book is second from the left.\n\nHere's the information given:\n1.  Red book is to the right of the gray book (G R)\n2.  Black book is to the left of the blue book (B L)\n3.  Blue book is to the left of the gray book (B G)\n4.  Purple book is the second from the right (_ _ _ P _)\n\nLet's combine the relative positions:\nFrom (3) and (1): B G R\nFrom (2): B L B. This means L B G R.\nSo, the order is Black, Blue, Gray, Red.\n\nNow, let's place the Purple book.\nThe Purple book is the second from the right.\nWe have 5 positions: _ _ _ _ _\nThe known order is B L G R. This is 4 books.\nIf Purple is second from the right, then the order must be:\n_ B L G R\nOr, if L is Black: B L G R.\nLet's re-evaluate the combination.\n\n1. Red > Gray (G R)\n2. Black < Blue (B L)\n3.
