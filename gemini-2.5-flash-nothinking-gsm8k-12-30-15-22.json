["<think>\nHere's my thinking process to solve this word problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks \"How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\" This means I need to find the number of eggs sold and multiply it by the price per egg.\n\n2.  **Break Down the Information:**\n    *   Total eggs laid: 16 per day.\n    *   Eggs eaten for breakfast: 3 per day.\n    *   Eggs used for muffins: 4 per day.\n    *   Selling price: $2 per egg.\n\n3.  **Calculate Eggs Remaining After Personal Use:**\n    *   Start with total eggs: 16\n    *   Subtract breakfast eggs: 16 - 3 = 13\n    *   Subtract muffin eggs: 13 - 4 = 9\n    *   So, Janet sells 9 eggs at the market.\n\n4.  **Calculate Daily Earnings:**\n    *   Number of eggs sold: 9\n    *   Price per egg: $2\n    *   Total earnings: 9 * $2 = $18\n\n5.  **Formulate the Answer:** Combine the calculated earnings into the required format.\n</think>\n<answer>\nJanet lays 16 eggs.\nShe eats 3 for breakfast: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.\nShe bakes with 4 for muffins: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.\nShe sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market.\nEach egg sells for $2.\nDaily earnings: 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.\n\nJanet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n</answer>", "<think>\nThe problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt also states that it takes half that much white fiber.\n\"Half that much\" refers to half of the blue fiber amount.\nSo, white fiber = 2 bolts / 2 = 1 bolt.\nTo find the total number of bolts, I need to add the blue fiber bolts and the white fiber bolts.\nTotal bolts = Blue bolts + White bolts.\nTotal bolts = 2 + 1.\n</think>\n<answer>\nIt takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt takes half that much white fiber, which is 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.\nTotal bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.\n</answer>", "<think> Here's my thinking process to calculate Josh's profit:\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Costs:**\n    *   Purchase price: $80,000\n    *   Repair cost: $50,000\n    *   Total initial investment = Purchase price + Repair cost\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Initial Investment:**\n    *   $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n3.  **Calculate the Increase in Value:**\n    *   The problem states the value increased by 150%. This means the *increase itself* is 150% of the initial investment.\n    *   Increase amount = 150% of $130,000 = 1.50 * $130,000\n\n4.  **Calculate the New Value (Selling Price):**\n    *   New Value = Initial Investment + Increase Amount\n    *   Alternatively, if the value increased *by* 150%, the new value is 100% (original) + 150% (increase) = 250% of the initial investment.\n    *   New Value = 2.50 * $130,000\n\n5.  **Calculate Profit:**\n    *   Profit = New Value - Total Initial Investment\n\nLet's do the calculations:\n*   Total initial investment = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n*   Increased value = $130,000 * 150% = $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000 (This is the *amount of increase*)\n*   New value of the house = Original investment + Increased value = $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000\n*   Profit = New value - Total initial investment = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000\n\nLet's double check using the \"250% of initial investment\" method for the new value:\n*   New Value = $130,000 * 2.50 = $325,000. (Matches)\n*   Profit = $325,000 - $130,000 = $195,000. (Matches)\n\nThe phrasing \"increased the value of the house by 150%\" means the *increase amount* is 150% of the *total cost*. The new value is the original cost plus this increase.\n<think>\n1.  **Calculate the total cost of the house:** This includes the purchase price and the repair costs.\n    $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000 (total cost)\n\n2.  **Calculate the amount of the increase in value:** The value increased by 150% of the total cost.\n    $130,000 * 150% = $130,000 * 1.50 = $195,000 (increase in value)\n\n3.  **Calculate the new value of the house:** This is the total cost plus the increase in value.\n    $130,000 (total cost) + $195,000 (increase) = $325,000 (new value)\n\n4.  **Calculate the profit:** This is the new value minus the total cost.\n    $325,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total cost) = $195,000 (profit)\n</think>\n<answer>\nJosh's total investment in the house was $80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000.\nThe value of the house increased by 150% of this total investment: $130,000 * 1.50 = $195,000.\nThe new value of the house is the original investment plus the increase: $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000.", "<think> The user is asking for the total distance James runs in a week.\nI need to calculate:\n1.

Calculate total distance per session: 60 meters/sprint * 3 sprints/session\n2. Calculate total distance per week: (Distance per session) * 3 sessions/week </think>\n<answer> James runs 60 meters per sprint.\nHe does 3 sprints per session, so he runs 60 * 3 = 180 meters per session.\nHe runs 3 times a week, so he runs 180 * 3 = 540 meters a week.\n\nHe runs a total of 540 meters a week. </answer>", "<think> The user is asking to calculate the amount of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.\nI know:\n- Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day.\n- There are 20 chickens in the flock.\n- Morning meal: 15 cups.\n- Afternoon meal: 25 cups.\n\nFirst, calculate the total daily feed needed for the entire flock.\nTotal daily feed = (cups per chicken) * (number of chickens)\n\nThen, calculate the total feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.\nFeed given so far = Morning meal + Afternoon meal\n\nFinally, subtract the feed given so far from the total daily feed to find the amount needed for the final meal.\nFinal meal feed = Total daily feed - Feed given so far </think>\n<answer> First, calculate the total amount of feed Wendi's flock needs per day:\n20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups of feed per day.\n\nNext, calculate the amount of feed already given in the morning and afternoon:\n15 cups (morning) + 25 cups (afternoon) = 40 cups of feed.\n\nFinally, subtract the amount already given from the total daily feed to find out how much is needed for the final meal:\n60 cups (total daily) - 40 cups (given so far) = 20 cups.\n\nWendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. </answer>"]
