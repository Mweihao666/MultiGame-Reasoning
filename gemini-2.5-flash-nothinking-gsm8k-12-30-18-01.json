["<think> The user is asking to calculate the daily earnings from selling duck eggs.\nHere's the plan:\n1. Start with the total number of eggs laid per day.\n2. Subtract the eggs eaten for breakfast.\n3. Subtract the eggs used for baking muffins.\n4. The remaining eggs are sold.\n5. Multiply the number of sold eggs by the price per egg to find the daily earnings. </think>\n<answer> Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\nShe eats 3 for breakfast, so 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.\nShe bakes with 4 eggs, so 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.\nShe sells 9 eggs at the farmers' market.\nEach egg sells for $2.\nSo, 9 eggs * $2/egg = $18.\n\nJanet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market. </answer>", "<think> The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\nIt also states that it takes half that much white fiber.\n\"Half that much\" refers to half the amount of blue fiber.\nSo, white fiber = 0.5 * blue fiber.\nWhite fiber = 0.5 * 2 bolts = 1 bolt.\nTo find the total number of bolts, I need to add the blue fiber bolts and the white fiber bolts.\nTotal bolts = Blue fiber bolts + White fiber bolts.\nTotal bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt.\nTotal bolts = 3 bolts. </think>\n<answer> 3 bolts </answer>", "<think> Here's my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The ultimate goal is to find Josh's *profit*. Profit is calculated as (Selling Price) - (Total Costs).\n\n2.  **Identify Costs:**\n    *   Initial purchase price: $80,000\n    *   Repair costs: $50,000\n    *   Total Costs = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000\n\n3.  **Determine the Selling Price (Increased Value):**\n    *   The problem states the *value of the house* increased by 150%. This means the *original value* ($80,000) is the base for the increase.\n    *   Increase amount = 150% of $80,000\n    *   150% as a decimal is 1.50\n    *   Increase amount = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n    *   New Value (Selling Price) = Original Value + Increase Amount\n    *   New Value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000\n\n    *Self-correction/Alternative interpretation check:* Sometimes \"increased the value of the house by 150%\" could be interpreted as \"the new value is 150% *of* the original value\". Let's test this: 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000. This would mean the house is now worth $120,000. However, \"increased *by* 150%\" implies adding that percentage to the original. So, if it increased *by* 100%, it would double. If it increased *by* 150%, it's the original + 1.5 * original = 2.5 * original.\n    *   Let's re-read carefully: \"This increased the value of the house by 150%.\"\n    *   Original Value = $80,000\n    *   Increase = 150% * $80,000 = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000\n    *   New Value = Original Value + Increase = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. This seems correct. The house's value went from $80,000 to $200,000, which is an increase *of* $120,000, and $120,000 is 150% of $80,000.\n\n4.  **Calculate Profit:**\n    *   Profit = Selling Price - Total Costs\n    *   Profit = $200,000 - $130,000\n    *   Profit = $70,000\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   Costs: $80k + $50k = $130k\n    *   Original Value: $80k\n    *   Increase: 150% of $80k = $120k\n    *   New Value: $80k + $120k = $200k\n    *   Profit: $200k - $130k = $70k. All calculations seem sound. </think>\n<answer> Josh's total cost for the house is the purchase price plus the repairs:\n$80,000 (purchase) + $50,000 (repairs) = $130,000 (total cost)\n\nThe value of the house increased by 150% of its original value:\n150% of $80,000 = 1.50 * $80,000 = $120,000\n\nThe new value of the house is the original value plus the increase:\n$80,000 (original value) + $120,000 (increase) = $200,000 (new value)\n\nTo find the profit, subtract the total cost from the new value:\n$200,000 (new value) - $13", "<think> The user is asking for the total meters James runs in a week.\nI need to calculate:\n1.
